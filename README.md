# ModelForge

ModelForge is a powerful and user-friendly platform that simplifies the machine learning process, allowing you to build and deploy models without extensive coding. It simplifies model setup and requirements with config files. Improves productivity and saves time for ML practitioners by allowing them to plug in parameters and utilize different models according to their needs.

## How it Works

- **Load Your Dataset:** Simply provide the path to your dataset CSV file and the corresponding YAML configuration file.

- **Specify Model Requirements:** In the YAML file, define the desired model architecture, input and output features, preprocessing steps, and evaluation metrics.

## Key Features:

- **Low-Code Approach:** No extensive coding is required. Simply provide the necessary information in the YAML file.
- **Flexibility:** Customize your models by specifying different architectures, features, and preprocessing steps.
- **Efficiency:** ModelForge automates many time-consuming tasks, saving you valuable time.

## Getting Started

Create a virtual environment, run the following command after cloning the repo

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment

- Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- MacOS:
  ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
  ```
  Install required python packages [Make sure virtual environment is running]

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the file

```bash
modelforge run --config path/to/file.yaml
```

```bash
 python main.py <filename>.yaml
```
